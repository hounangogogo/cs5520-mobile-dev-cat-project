# HiPet!

## Problems to solve
Our application is an online, searchable database of animals who need homes/lost pets. 
It is a directory of nearly 239 cat/dog breeds across the world.
### Our mission
To use Internet technology and the resources it can generate to:
1. Increase public awareness of the availability of high-quality adoptable pets
2. Increase the overall effectiveness of pet adoption programs across the U.S. to the extent that the euthanasia of adoptable pets is eliminated
3. Elevate the status of pets to that of family member and recommand pets for pet lovers. Pet lovers can search for a pet that best matches their needs. 
4. Users could report their lost pets in our website. Hopes these lovely gugys could find their home as soon as possible.
